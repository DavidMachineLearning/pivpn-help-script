# pivpn-help-script
This is a simple script used to keep your pivpn settings updated in case you don't have a static public ip address
and you don't want to use a dynamic DNS provider.

Before running the script make sure to read instructions.txt and read my post [here](https://davidforino-aisolutions.com) to see how to setup pivpn and gmail.
